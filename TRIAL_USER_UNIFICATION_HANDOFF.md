# Trial User Architecture Unification - Handoff Document

**Date Started:** 2025-10-19
**Status:** IN PROGRESS
**Goal:** Simplify trial user architecture so trial users work exactly like regular users with an `is_trial` flag

---

## üéØ PROBLEM STATEMENT

Current architecture has too many special cases for trial users:
- Separate TrialDashboard component
- Complex routing logic with multiple fallbacks (localStorage, sessionStorage)
- Special API handling (mock data for trial users)
- Separate auth flows (TrialLogin vs ClientLogin)
- Race condition workarounds everywhere

**NEW APPROACH:** Trial users = Regular users + `is_trial` flag

---

## üìã WORK PLAN

### Phase 1: Database Migration ‚úÖ
- [x] Run `backend/migrations/unify_trial_user_architecture.sql`
- [x] Verify migration results
- [x] Confirm all trial users have businesses
- [x] Confirm all trial agents have business_id (3 linked, 4 orphaned without email)

**Migration Details:**
- Adds `is_trial BOOLEAN` column to users table
- Adds `trial_expires_at TIMESTAMP` column to users table
- Creates businesses for existing trial users
- Links trial users to businesses
- Links trial agents to businesses

### Phase 2: Backend Updates ‚úÖ
- [x] Update auth endpoints to include `is_trial` and `trial_expires_at` in user data
  - Updated /api/auth/login (client SELECT and userData response)
  - Updated /api/auth/verify-client-mfa (SELECT and userData response)
  - Updated /api/auth/agent-magic-login (SELECT and userData response)
- [x] Added `business_id` to all user data responses
- [ ] Update agent endpoints to work with business-linked trial agents
- [ ] Remove any trial-specific endpoint logic (will do in cleanup phase)

### Phase 3: Frontend Auth Updates ‚úÖ
- [x] Update AuthUser interface in src/types/database.ts
  - Added `businessId?: string`
  - Added `businessName?: string`
  - Added `trialExpiresAt?: string`
  - Added `agentId?: string` (for magic-link access)
  - Marked `trialAgentId` and `trialId` as deprecated (legacy)
- [x] EnhancedAuthContext automatically uses updated AuthUser interface
- [x] Login flows will now receive `is_trial` flag from backend

### Phase 4: Dashboard Unification ‚úÖ
- [x] Simplified App.tsx routing - removed all trial-specific routing logic
  - Removed check for `trialAgentId` (deprecated)
  - Removed routing to TrialDashboard
  - All clients now route to ClientDashboard
- [x] Add trial UI to ClientDashboard (banner, trial expiry info)
  - Added trial banner showing trial status and expiration date
  - Banner displays when `authUser.isTrial` is true
  - Prominent blue gradient banner with call-to-action
- [x] ClientDashboard now handles all client types (trial, regular, magic-link)

### Phase 5: Cleanup ‚è≥
- [x] TrialDashboard component - DEPRECATED (import commented out in App.tsx)
  - No longer used for routing
  - Can be deleted or kept as reference
- [ ] TrialLogin component - KEEP FOR NOW
  - Still needed for /auth/trial-magic-login endpoint
  - Consider merging with AgentLogin in future
- [x] Simplified App.tsx routing (removed trial-specific logic)
- [ ] Review localStorage/sessionStorage usage for trial-specific code
- [ ] AgentSelector component - needs review (used in TrialDashboard)

### Phase 6: Testing ‚è≥
- [ ] Test trial user login
- [ ] Test trial user dashboard access
- [ ] Test trial agent visibility
- [ ] Test trial to paid conversion flow
- [ ] Test magic-link agent access

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUES ENCOUNTERED

### Issue #1: Agent Heartbeat Endpoint Not Updated for Unified Architecture

**Status:** üî¥ CRITICAL - Needs Fixing

**Problem:**
The agent heartbeat endpoint `/api/agents/trial/heartbeat` in `backend/routes/agents.js` still uses the OLD trial architecture:
- Creates trial agents with `business_id = NULL` (line 371)
- Creates users with `business_id = null` (line 449)
- Uses `trial_users` table instead of unified `users` table

**Impact:**
- New trial agents won't be linked to businesses
- Trial users won't appear in unified `users` table with `is_trial` flag
- Agent will work but won't integrate with our new unified architecture

**What Needs To Be Fixed:**
The `/api/agents/trial/heartbeat` endpoint (lines 240-500 in `backend/routes/agents.js`) needs to:

1. **Create/get a real business** for the trial user (not NULL)
   - Business name: `Trial - {email}` or similar
   - Store business UUID

2. **Create user in `users` table** (not `trial_users`) with:
   - `is_trial = true`
   - `trial_expires_at = NOW() + 30 days`
   - `business_id = <real business UUID>`
   - `email_verified = true`

3. **Link agent to business**:
   - Set `business_id = <real business UUID>` (not NULL)

4. **Update `getOrCreateTrialUser` utility** in `backend/utils/trialEmailVerificationUtils.js`:
   - Should create/update users in `users` table with `is_trial` flag
   - Should create associated business
   - Remove dependency on `trial_users` table

**Agent Code:**
- ‚úÖ Agent code in `/Users/louis/New/01_Projects/rts-monitoring-agent` is FINE - no changes needed
- Agent just sends `trial_email` to backend
- Backend needs to handle the unified architecture

**Priority:** HIGH - Should be fixed before next trial agent registration

**UPDATE: ‚úÖ FIXED!**
- Updated `getOrCreateTrialUser()` in `backend/utils/trialEmailVerificationUtils.js`
  - Now creates users in `users` table with `is_trial = true`
  - Creates real businesses for trial users
  - Returns `{ userId, businessId, isVerified }`
- Updated `/api/agents/trial/heartbeat` in `backend/routes/agents.js`
  - Agents now linked to real businesses (not NULL)
  - Uses unified user records from `users` table
  - Removed old trial user creation logic with NULL business_id

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/utils/trialEmailVerificationUtils.js` - getOrCreateTrialUser() function
- `backend/routes/agents.js` - /api/agents/trial/heartbeat endpoint

---

### Issue #2: Trial Device Limit Enforcement

**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Requirement:**
Trial users should be limited to 2 devices running agents. If they want to add a third device, they should be given a magic link to remove existing device(s).

**What's Been Done:**
‚úÖ Backend enforcement in `/api/agents/trial/heartbeat`:
  - Checks agent count before accepting new trial agent
  - Returns `TRIAL_DEVICE_LIMIT_REACHED` error if limit exceeded
  - Provides management URL in error response

‚úÖ Agent handling in `rts-monitoring-agent`:
  - Detects device limit error gracefully
  - Displays helpful message with management URL
  - Returns URL for potential browser opening

‚úÖ Backend DELETE endpoint (`DELETE /api/agents/:agent_id`):
  - Allow users to deactivate their own agents
  - Proper RBAC checks (trial_user_id or business_id ownership)
  - Sets is_active = false (soft delete)
  - Employees can deactivate any agent; clients can only deactivate their own

‚úÖ Trial Devices UI (`TrialDevicesManager` component):
  - Shows list of user's agents with status
  - Displays device limit (X/2 devices)
  - Allow removal/deactivation with confirmation dialog
  - Shows trial expiration date
  - Only visible in "My Devices" tab for trial users
  - Responsive design (mobile + desktop)

**How It Works:**
1. Trial user tries to install agent on 3rd device
2. Agent sends heartbeat ‚Üí backend rejects with `TRIAL_DEVICE_LIMIT_REACHED`
3. Agent displays error with magic-link
4. User clicks link ‚Üí logs into dashboard
5. Navigates to "My Devices" tab
6. Clicks remove button on unwanted device
7. Confirms removal ‚Üí device deactivated
8. Can now install agent on new device

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/routes/agents.js` - Device limit check + DELETE endpoint
- `rts-monitoring-agent/internal/trial/trial.go` - Error handling
- `src/pages/ClientDashboard.tsx` - Added "My Devices" tab for trial users
- `src/components/client/TrialDevicesManager.tsx` - NEW component for device management

---

### Issue #3: Multi-Device Trial Registration

**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Problem:**
When a trial user tried to install the agent on a second device using the same email address, the system rejected them saying "email already in use". This was confusing because trial users are allowed up to 2 devices.

**Solution:**
Updated the email verification flow to distinguish between:
1. **Trial users** (is_trial = true) ‚Üí Allow adding additional devices
2. **Paid users** (is_trial = false) ‚Üí Reject (they should use normal registration)
3. **New users** ‚Üí Create new trial account

**What Was Changed:**

‚úÖ Backend (`checkEmailNotRegistered` function):
- Now checks `is_trial` flag
- Trial users can reuse their email to add devices
- Paid users are still blocked from trial registration
- Clear messaging: "You are adding another device to your existing trial account"

‚úÖ Backend (`/trial/send-verification` endpoint):
- Returns `isExistingTrialUser` flag in response
- Provides appropriate messaging for each case

‚úÖ Agent (`EnableTrialMode` function):
- Displays special message when user is adding another device
- Shows: "Adding Another Device - You are adding this device to your existing trial account"
- User experience is clear and seamless

**How It Works Now:**

```
User on Device #1:
1. Enters email: user@example.com
2. Gets verification code
3. Verifies ‚Üí Creates trial account
4. Agent registers with backend

User on Device #2 (same email):
1. Enters same email: user@example.com
2. System recognizes existing trial account
3. Shows: "Adding another device to existing trial account"
4. Gets verification code
5. Verifies ‚Üí Links to existing trial account
6. Both devices now under same trial account!

User tries Device #3:
1. Agent sends heartbeat
2. Backend: "Device limit reached (2/2)"
3. Shows magic-link to manage devices
4. User removes one device ‚Üí can add new one
```

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/utils/trialEmailVerificationUtils.js` - checkEmailNotRegistered updated
- `backend/routes/agents.js` - /trial/send-verification updated
- `rts-monitoring-agent/internal/trial/trial.go` - Multi-device messaging

### Issue #4: Verification Code Validation and Old Architecture Conflict

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:**
Users were getting verification failures when trying to add additional trial devices. Two issues discovered:

1. **Verification Code Validation** - Codes were rejected even when correct (e.g., 224327)
2. **Old Architecture Conflict** - After code validation passed, endpoint failed with "Email already registered as full account"

**Root Causes:**

**Issue 4a - Code Validation:**
The backend validation function (`validateTrialEmailVerificationCode`) was using strict equality comparison (`!==`) without defensive trimming or type normalization.

**Issue 4b - Old Architecture:**
The `/api/agents/trial/verify-email` endpoint was still calling the OLD `confirmTrialEmailAndCreateUser` function which tried to create records in the deprecated `trial_users` table. This conflicted with the unified architecture where trial users exist in the main `users` table with `is_trial = true`.

**Error Message Seen:**
```
‚ùå Error confirming trial email and creating user: error: Email address louis_romero@hotmail.com is already registered as a full account.
    at check_trial_email_not_registered() line 7 at RAISE
```

**Solutions:**

**Fix 4a - Defensive Code Validation:**
Updated `backend/utils/trialEmailVerificationUtils.js`:
```javascript
// Before:
if (record.verification_code !== verificationCode) {
  return { valid: false, message: 'Invalid verification code' };
}

// After:
const storedCode = String(record.verification_code).trim();
const providedCode = String(verificationCode).trim();

console.log(`üîç Comparing verification codes for ${email}:`);
console.log(`   Stored:   "${storedCode}" (length: ${storedCode.length})`);
console.log(`   Provided: "${providedCode}" (length: ${providedCode.length})`);

if (storedCode !== providedCode) {
  console.log(`‚ùå Code mismatch!`);
  return { valid: false, message: 'Invalid verification code' };
}
```

**Fix 4b - Unified Architecture Endpoint:**
Updated `/api/agents/trial/verify-email` in `backend/routes/agents.js`:
```javascript
// Before (OLD - tried to create trial_users records):
const { trialUserId } = await confirmTrialEmailAndCreateUser(email, {...});

// After (NEW - uses unified users table):
const { userId, businessId } = await getOrCreateTrialUser(email);

// Mark verification code as used
await query(`UPDATE trial_email_verifications SET used = TRUE WHERE email = $1`, [email]);

// Mark user's email as verified in main users table
await query(`UPDATE users SET email_verified = TRUE WHERE id = $1`, [userId]);

// Return both user_id and business_id
res.json({
  success: true,
  data: {
    trial_user_id: userId,  // Backward compat field name
    user_id: userId,
    business_id: businessId,
    verified: true
  }
});
```

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/utils/trialEmailVerificationUtils.js` - validateTrialEmailVerificationCode function
- `backend/routes/agents.js` - /api/agents/trial/verify-email endpoint (lines 119-187)

---

### Issue #5: Trial Magic-Link Missing businessId

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:**
Trial users logging in via magic-link from their agent dashboard received "Permission Denied" error:
```
Permission Denied
This agent does not belong to your business

Action Attempted: View Agent Details
Required Permission: view agents
```

**Root Cause:**
The `/api/auth/trial-magic-login` endpoint was still querying the deprecated `trial_users` table and NOT including `businessId` in the userData response. The frontend permission check in `AgentDetails.tsx` compares:
```javascript
const canAccess = canViewAgents || (isClient && agentResponse.data.business_id === userBusinessId);
```

Since `userBusinessId` was undefined (no businessId in authUser), the check failed even though the user and agent had matching business_ids in the database.

**Database Evidence:**
```
User:  { id: be4707de-..., business_id: 44849565-... }
Agent: { id: f71fb666-..., business_id: 44849565-... } // SAME!
```

Backend logs showed successful authentication but frontend couldn't verify ownership.

**Solution:**
Updated `/api/auth/trial-magic-login` endpoint to use unified architecture:

**Before (OLD - queried trial_users):**
```javascript
const agentResult = await query(`
  SELECT ad.id as agent_id, ad.trial_access_code, ad.trial_user_id,
         tu.id as user_id, tu.email, tu.contact_name, tu.email_verified
  FROM agent_devices ad
  INNER JOIN trial_users tu ON tu.id = ad.trial_user_id
  WHERE ad.id = $1 AND ad.is_trial = true
`, [trialUUID]);

const userData = {
  businessName: null,  // ‚ùå Missing businessId!
  isTrial: true,
  // ...
};
```

**After (NEW - queries unified users):**
```javascript
const agentResult = await query(`
  SELECT ad.id as agent_id, ad.trial_access_code, ad.business_id,
         u.id as user_id, u.email, u.first_name, u.last_name,
         u.email_verified, u.is_trial, u.trial_expires_at,
         b.business_name
  FROM agent_devices ad
  LEFT JOIN users u ON u.business_id = ad.business_id AND u.is_trial = true
  LEFT JOIN businesses b ON ad.business_id = b.id
  WHERE ad.id = $1 AND ad.is_trial = true AND ad.is_active = true
`, [trialUUID]);

const userData = {
  businessId: user.business_id,      // ‚úÖ Now included!
  businessName: user.business_name,  // ‚úÖ Now included!
  isTrial: user.is_trial || true,
  trialExpiresAt: user.trial_expires_at,
  agentId: agent.agent_id,
  // ...
};
```

**Testing:**
After deployment, trial magic-link login now includes businessId, allowing frontend permission checks to pass.

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/routes/auth.js` - /api/auth/trial-magic-login endpoint (lines 2428-2533)

**Version:** v1.101.28

## üéâ ACCOMPLISHMENTS SUMMARY

### What Changed:
**BEFORE:** Trial users had special routing, separate dashboard, mock API data, complex localStorage hacks

**AFTER:** Trial users are just regular users with `is_trial = true` flag

### Key Improvements:
1. **Database Schema** - Added `is_trial` and `trial_expires_at` to users table
2. **Business Association** - All trial users now have businesses (like regular users)
3. **Unified Auth** - Backend returns trial flags in all login endpoints
4. **Simplified Routing** - Removed 50+ lines of complex trial routing logic
5. **Single Dashboard** - ClientDashboard handles trial, regular, and magic-link users
6. **Trial UI** - Beautiful banner shows trial status and expiration
7. **Type Safety** - Updated AuthUser interface with trial fields
8. **Device Limit Enforcement** - Trial users limited to 2 devices with management UI
9. **Multi-Device Support** - Trial users can seamlessly add devices using same email
10. **Robust Validation** - Defensive code validation with detailed logging for debugging

### Code Removed/Simplified:
- ‚ùå Removed: Complex trial routing in App.tsx (~50 lines)
- ‚ùå Removed: localStorage fallback hacks for trial users
- ‚ùå Removed: sessionStorage pendingAgentId logic
- ‚ùå Deprecated: TrialDashboard component (no longer routed to)
- ‚ùå Deprecated: `trialAgentId` and `trialId` fields

### Files Modified:
**Backend:**
- `backend/migrations/unify_trial_user_architecture.sql` (NEW - migration script)
- `backend/routes/auth.js` (4 login endpoints: client, verify-mfa, trial-magic-link, agent-magic-link)
- `backend/routes/agents.js` (heartbeat, verify-email, device limit, DELETE endpoint)
- `backend/utils/trialEmailVerificationUtils.js` (getOrCreateTrialUser, validation fixes)

**Frontend:**
- `src/types/database.ts` (AuthUser interface updated)
- `src/App.tsx` (routing simplified - removed ~50 lines)
- `src/pages/ClientDashboard.tsx` (trial banner + devices tab)
- `src/components/client/TrialDevicesManager.tsx` (NEW - device management UI)

**Agent:**
- `rts-monitoring-agent/internal/trial/trial.go` (device limit error handling)

**Documentation:**
- `TRIAL_USER_UNIFICATION_HANDOFF.md` (NEW - complete handoff documentation)

### Migration to Paid:
When trial user converts to paid:
```sql
UPDATE users
SET is_trial = false,
    trial_expires_at = NULL
WHERE id = 'user-id';
```
That's it! No complex data migration needed.
