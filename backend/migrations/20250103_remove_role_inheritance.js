/**
 * Migration: Remove role inheritance by explicitly granting inherited permissions
 *
 * This migration converts the role inheritance system to a purely granular permission model.
 * Before removing inheritance logic, we explicitly grant all permissions that were previously
 * inherited to ensure no functionality breaks.
 *
 * Inheritance that will be removed:
 * - executive inherits from: admin, manager, sales, technician
 * - admin inherits from: technician
 * - manager inherits from: technician
 * - sales inherits from: (none)
 * - technician inherits from: (none)
 *
 * Created: 2025-01-03
