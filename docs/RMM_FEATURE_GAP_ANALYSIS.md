# RMM Feature Gap Analysis
**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Executive Summary

After analyzing the current RTS platform and monitoring agent capabilities against industry-standard RMM solutions (ConnectWise Automate, NinjaRMM, Datto RMM), we've identified **12 core feature categories** where we have gaps that prevent us from being a competitive, full-featured MSP/RMM platform.

## What We Currently Have âœ…

### Service Desk/PSA (Strong)
- Service request management with workflow automation
- Invoice & payment processing (Stripe)
- Client portal with file management
- Multi-language support (EN/ES)
- Role-based permissions (RBAC)
- Email/SMS/Push notifications
- MFA and security features

### Monitoring Agent (Good Foundation)
- **Performance metrics**: CPU, memory, disk, network I/O
- **System health**: Patch status, OS EOL tracking, uptime monitoring
- **Hardware monitoring**: SMART disk health, temperatures, fan speeds
- **Service monitoring**: Critical service status detection
- **Security monitoring**: Antivirus/firewall status, failed login detection
- **Network monitoring**: Basic connectivity tests, network device ping
- **Backup detection**: Auto-discovery of backup software status
- **Event logs**: Critical events and error tracking
- **Package managers**: Homebrew, npm, pip, mas outdated detection
- **Alerting**: Confluence-based technical indicator alerts with WebSocket
- **Remote commands**: Basic script execution, system info, agent restart

- Pre-built script library (500+ templates)
- Drag-and-drop automation builder
- Compliance policy templates (HIPAA, SOC 2, PCI-DSS)

**What We Have:** Manual remote command execution only

**Business Impact:** High manual workload; can't scale MSP operations efficiently

---

### 4. **Advanced Reporting & Analytics** ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY

- Customizable report builder
- SLA tracking and reporting
- Client-facing executive reports
- Trend analysis and capacity planning
- Business intelligence dashboards
- Scheduled/automated report delivery
- Compliance audit reports

**What We Have:** Real-time metrics charts only

**Business Impact:** Can't demonstrate value to clients or track SLA compliance

---

### 5. **Remote Access & Control** ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY
**What MSPs Expect:**
- Built-in remote desktop (RDP/VNC/SSH)
- Unattended remote access
- Multi-monitor support
- File transfer capabilities
- Remote command prompt/terminal
- Session recording for compliance

**What We Have:** Command execution only (no screen sharing/remote desktop)

**Business Impact:** MSPs must use separate tools (TeamViewer, AnyDesk, etc.)

---

### 6. **Mobile Device Management (MDM)** ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY
**What MSPs Expect:**
- iOS/Android device management
- Mobile policy enforcement
- App deployment and restrictions
- Device encryption requirements
- Remote wipe capabilities
- Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) - single platform for all devices

**What We Have:** Desktop/server only (no mobile support)

**Business Impact:** Can't manage BYOD or mobile-first clients

---

### 7. **Deep Ticketing Integration** ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY
**What MSPs Expect:**
- Automatic ticket creation from alerts
- Alert-to-ticket workflow automation
- Time tracking integration
- Ticket escalation based on alert severity
- PSA/RMM unified interface

**What We Have:** Service desk exists separately; no RMMâ†’ticket automation

**Business Impact:** Manual ticket creation; alerts don't flow into service workflow

---

### 8. **Backup Management (Beyond Detection)** ðŸŸ¢ LOWER PRIORITY
**What MSPs Expect:**
- Backup configuration and scheduling
- Automated backup testing/verification
- Restore capabilities and testing
- Backup storage monitoring
- Integration with backup vendors (Veeam, Acronis, etc.)

**What We Have:** Detection of backup software status only

**Business Impact:** Can see backup issues but can't fix them remotely

---

### 9. **Advanced Network Monitoring** ðŸŸ¢ LOWER PRIORITY
**What MSPs Expect:**
- SNMP monitoring (switches, routers, firewalls)
- Bandwidth monitoring and alerts
- Network topology mapping
- Configuration backup for network devices
- Port monitoring and security scanning

**What We Have:** Basic ping/http checks for network devices

**Business Impact:** Limited visibility into network infrastructure health

---

### 10. **Vulnerability Management** ðŸŸ¢ LOWER PRIORITY
**What MSPs Expect:**
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) tracking
- Security posture scoring
- Remediation recommendations
- Integration with vulnerability databases

**What We Have:** Patch detection only (no vulnerability scoring)

**Business Impact:** Can't proactively identify security risks

---

### 11. **Third-Party Integrations** ðŸŸ¢ LOWER PRIORITY

- PSA integration (ConnectWise, Autotask)
- Azure AD/Entra ID synchronization
- Communication tools (Slack, Teams, Discord webhooks)
- Documentation platforms (IT Glue, Hudu, Confluence)
- Password managers (1Password, LastPass, Bitwarden)
- Cybersecurity tools (SentinelOne, CrowdStrike, etc.)

**What We Have:** Custom-built integrations only (Stripe, AWS)

**Business Impact:** Can't fit into existing MSP workflows/ecosystems

---

### 12. **Scripting Library & AI Automation** ðŸŸ¢ LOWER PRIORITY
**What MSPs Expect:**
- 500+ pre-built automation scripts
- AI-powered script generation (like N-central)
- Community script sharing
- Script version control
- Script testing environments

**What We Have:** Custom scripts only (no library/templates)

**Business Impact:** Every MSP reinvents the wheel for common tasks

---

## Recommended Priorities

### Phase 1 (Core RMM Functionality) - 3-6 months
1. **Software Deployment Engine** - Deploy patches, updates, software packages
2. **Asset Management System** - Full hardware/software inventory tracking
3. **Policy-Based Automation** - Apply configurations to device groups
4. **Alertâ†’Ticket Integration** - Automate service request creation from alerts

### Phase 2 (Competitive Feature Parity) - 6-12 months
5. **Advanced Reporting** - Customizable reports, SLA tracking
6. **Remote Desktop Integration** - Built-in or partner with vendor
7. **Script Library** - Pre-built templates for common tasks
8. **Backup Management** - Configuration and testing capabilities

### Phase 3 (Market Differentiation) - 12+ months
9. **Mobile Device Management (MDM/UEM)** - Expand beyond desktop/server
10. **Network Monitoring** - SNMP, topology mapping, device configs
11. **Third-Party Integrations** - PSA, documentation, security tools
12. **Vulnerability Management** - CVE tracking, security scoring

---

## Key Takeaway

**We have a solid foundation** (monitoring, alerting, service desk), but we're missing the **automation, deployment, and asset management** features that MSPs consider non-negotiable for daily operations. Without these, we're more of a "monitoring + service desk" platform rather than a true RMM solution.
