Phase 1 focuses on implementing the foundational RMM features that MSPs consider non-negotiable:
1. Software Deployment Engine
2. Asset Management System
3. Policy-Based Automation
4. Alert→Ticket Integration

## 3. Policy-Based Automation

### Objective
Enable MSPs to create reusable policy templates and apply them to groups of devices.

### Database Schema Requirements

**Tables:**

- Script execution framework
- Compliance reporting
- Event-driven triggers

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/policies` - Create policy
- `GET /api/policies` - List policies
- `PUT /api/policies/:policy_id` - Update policy
- `POST /api/policies/:policy_id/assign` - Assign to agents/groups
- `POST /api/policies/:policy_id/execute` - Execute now
- `GET /api/policies/:policy_id/history` - Execution history
- `GET /api/scripts/library` - Pre-built scripts
- `POST /api/scripts` - Add custom script

### Frontend Components
- Policy builder interface
- Policy template gallery
- Script library browser
- Policy assignment manager
- Compliance dashboard

---

## 4. Alert→Ticket Integration

### Objective
Automatically create service requests from agent alerts with intelligent routing.

### Database Schema Requirements

**Tables:**
- `alert_ticket_rules` - Rules for alert-to-ticket conversion
- `alert_ticket_mappings` - Track which alerts created which tickets
- `ticket_escalation_rules` - Severity-based escalation

### Existing Tables to Extend
- `agent_alert_history` - Add `service_request_id` foreign key
- `service_requests` - Add `source_alert_id` foreign key

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/alerts/ticket-rules` - Create alert-to-ticket rule
- `GET /api/alerts/ticket-rules` - List rules
- `PUT /api/alerts/ticket-rules/:rule_id` - Update rule
- `POST /api/alerts/:alert_id/create-ticket` - Manual ticket creation
- `GET /api/alerts/:alert_id/ticket` - Get associated ticket

### Frontend Components
- Alert-to-ticket rule builder
- Alert dashboard with "Create Ticket" action
- Service request view showing source alert
- Alert history showing ticket associations

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Agent Performance** - Extensive inventory collection may impact system performance
   - *Mitigation:* Throttle collection, run during low-usage periods

2. **Security** - Software deployment is a high-risk operation
   - *Mitigation:* Package signature verification, approval workflows, audit logging

3. **Compatibility** - Different OS versions may require different approaches
   - *Mitigation:* Start with common OS versions, expand gradually

### Business Risks
1. **Scope Creep** - Feature requests may expand beyond Phase 1
   - *Mitigation:* Strict adherence to Phase 1 scope, defer Phase 2 requests

2. **Resource Constraints** - May need additional development resources
   - *Mitigation:* Prioritize features, MVP approach for initial releases

## Dependencies

### External Services
- Dell, HP, Lenovo warranty lookup APIs (for asset management)
- Package repositories for software deployment

### Internal Systems
- Service request system (existing - needs enhancement)
- Alert system (existing - needs integration)
- Agent infrastructure (existing - needs extension)

## Next Steps

1. **Review & Approve** - Stakeholder sign-off on implementation plan
2. **Create Migrations** - Database schema migrations for all Phase 1 features
3. **Agent Enhancement** - Begin extending agent capabilities
4. **Backend Development** - API endpoints for new features
5. **Frontend Development** - UI components for new features
6. **Testing** - Comprehensive testing before production rollout
