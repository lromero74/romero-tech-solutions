## Implementation Summary

### UUID v5 Trial ID Conversion ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Challenge:** Trial agents use `trial-{timestamp}` IDs (e.g., `trial-1760804299`), but the database expects UUIDs.

**Solution:** UUID v5 (name-based UUID) for deterministic conversion:
```javascript
// Namespace UUID for trial agents
const TRIAL_NAMESPACE = 'a8f5f167-d5e9-4c91-a3d2-7e5c8f9b1c4a';

function trialIdToUUID(trialId) {
  return uuidv5(trialId, TRIAL_NAMESPACE);
}

// Example:
// trial-1760804299 → 314315c5-3f2c-5b2d-9ba5-7dc82202237b (always the same UUID)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Same trial_id always converts to same UUID (deterministic)
- ✅ Database schema remains UUID-based (no VARCHAR migration needed)
- ✅ Original trial_id stored in `trial_original_id` column for reference
- ✅ Trial-to-paid conversion creates new UUID for registered agent

### 1. Trial Agent Endpoints ✅ COMPLETE

**File:** `/backend/routes/agents.js` (Lines 1-601)

#### Implemented Endpoints:
- ✅ `POST /api/agents/trial/heartbeat` - Accept heartbeat from trial agents (no auth)
- ✅ `POST /api/agents/trial/metrics` - Accept metrics from trial agents (no auth)
- ✅ `POST /api/agents/trial/convert` - Convert trial to registered agent with easy path
- ✅ `GET /api/agents/trial/status/:trial_id` - Get trial status

#### Key Features:
- Trial agents use `trial-{timestamp}` as agent_id
- NO authentication required for trial endpoints
- Automatic trial agent creation on first heartbeat
- 30-day trial period automatically calculated
- Trial expiration enforcement (rejects expired trials)
- Atomic trial conversion with data migration
- Transaction-based conversion (all-or-nothing)
- Preserves all metrics history during conversion
- Easy path from trial to paying customer

### 2. Database Schema Changes ✅ COMPLETE

**File:** `/backend/migrations/add_trial_agent_support.sql`

Created comprehensive migration with:
- Added `is_trial`, `trial_start_date`, `trial_end_date` columns
- Added `trial_converted_at`, `trial_converted_to_agent_id` columns
- Added `trial_original_id` to track trial ID after conversion
- Made `business_id` nullable for trial agents
- Created performance indexes for trial queries
- Created `trial_analytics` view for conversion tracking
- Created `get_trial_status()` SQL function
- Created `is_trial_expired()` SQL function
- Created trigger to prevent metrics from expired trials

### 3. Trial Analytics ⏳ PENDING

Track trial-to-paid conversion metrics:

```sql
-- Create trial analytics view
CREATE VIEW trial_analytics AS
SELECT
  DATE(trial_start_date) as trial_date,
  COUNT(*) as trials_started,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN trial_converted_at IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as trials_converted,
  ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(CASE WHEN trial_converted_at IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as conversion_rate,
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (trial_converted_at - trial_start_date)) / 86400) as avg_days_to_convert
FROM agent_devices
WHERE is_trial = true
GROUP BY DATE(trial_start_date)
ORDER BY trial_date DESC;
```

## Security Considerations

1. **No Authentication for Trial Endpoints**
   - Trial agents don't have JWT tokens
   - Use trial_id validation only
   - Rate limit trial endpoints to prevent abuse

2. **Data Isolation**
   - Trial metrics NOT visible in customer dashboards
   - Trial agents NOT associated with businesses
   - Trial data kept for analytics only

3. **Trial Expiration**
   - Reject metrics from expired trials (>30 days)
   - Soft-delete expired trial data after 90 days
   - Notify users before expiration

4. **Conversion Security**
   - Validate registration token before conversion
   - Ensure trial hasn't already been converted
   - Migrate data atomically (transaction)

---

## Migration Strategy

### Option A: Separate Trial Tables (NOT CHOSEN)
- `trial_agents` table separate from `agent_devices`
- `trial_metrics` table separate from `agent_metrics`
- Pros: Clean separation, no schema changes
- Cons: Duplicate structure, complex queries, migration complexity

### Option B: Shared Tables with is_trial Flag (CHOSEN)
- Add `is_trial` flag to existing tables
- Allow NULL business_id for trial agents
- Pros: Simple migration, shared codebase, easier conversion
- Cons: Need to filter trial data in queries

**Decision: Option B** - Simpler and more maintainable

## Frontend Implementation Details

### 1. Trial Agents Dashboard Component ✅
**File:** `src/components/admin/TrialAgentsDashboard.tsx`

**Features Implemented:**
- Summary statistics cards (6 metrics):
  - Total Trials
  - Active Trials
  - Expiring Soon (≤3 days)
  - Expired Trials
  - Converted Trials
  - Conversion Rate (%)
- Search functionality (device name, OS type, trial ID)
- Filter by status (all, active, expiring-soon, expired, converted)
- Sortable table columns (device name, expiration date, days remaining)
- Color-coded status badges:
  - 🟢 Green = Active (>3 days remaining)
  - 🟠 Orange = Expiring Soon (≤3 days)
  - 🔴 Red = Expired
  - 🔵 Blue = Converted
- Visual progress bars showing trial usage percentage
- Action buttons: "View Details" and "Convert to Paid"
- Permission integration: `view.agents.enable`

**Client-Side Trial Status Calculation:**
```typescript
const getTrialStatus = (agent: AgentDevice) => {
  const now = new Date();
  const startDate = new Date(agent.trial_start_date);
  const endDate = new Date(agent.trial_end_date);

  const daysRemaining = Math.ceil((endDate - now) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
  const percentUsed = Math.round(((now - startDate) / (endDate - startDate)) * 100);

  if (agent.trial_converted_at) return { status: 'converted', ... };
  if (daysRemaining <= 0) return { status: 'expired', ... };
  if (daysRemaining <= 3) return { status: 'expiring-soon', ... };
  return { status: 'active', ... };
};
```

### 2. Trial Conversion Modal Component ✅
**File:** `src/components/admin/TrialConversionModal.tsx`

**Features Implemented:**
- Multi-step workflow:
  1. **Business Selection Step:** Select which business to associate the agent with
  2. **Converting Step:** Shows loading spinner during conversion
  3. **Success Step:** Displays new agent ID and confirmation
  4. **Error Step:** Shows error message with retry option
- Business dropdown (loads active businesses only)
- "Preserve Data" checkbox (default: true)
  - When checked: migrates all trial metrics to the new agent
  - When unchecked: starts fresh with no historical data
- Automatic registration token creation (hidden from user)
- Transaction-based conversion (all-or-nothing)
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Theme-aware dark/light mode styling

**Conversion Flow:**
```typescript
1. User selects business
2. Click "Convert to Paid"
3. Modal creates registration token for selected business
4. Modal calls convertTrialAgent API with:
   - trial_id (trial-{timestamp} format)
   - registration_token
   - preserve_data flag
5. Backend performs atomic conversion:
   - Creates new registered agent with UUID
   - Optionally migrates metrics
   - Marks trial as converted
6. Success: navigates to new agent details page
```

### 3. Service Layer Integration ✅
**File:** `src/services/agentService.ts`

**Added Interfaces:**
```typescript
// Extended AgentDevice with trial fields
export interface AgentDevice {
  // ... existing fields ...
  is_trial?: boolean;
  trial_start_date?: string | null;
  trial_end_date?: string | null;
  trial_converted_at?: string | null;
  trial_converted_to_agent_id?: string | null;
  trial_original_id?: string | null;
}

// New trial status interface
export interface TrialAgentStatus {
  trial_id: string;
  device_name: string;
  status: 'active' | 'expired' | 'converted';
  days_remaining: number;
  percent_used: number;
  // ... additional fields
}
```

**Added Methods:**
- `getTrialStatus(trialId: string)` - GET /api/agents/trial/status/:trial_id
- `convertTrialAgent(data)` - POST /api/agents/trial/convert
- `listTrialAgents()` - Filters regular agent list for `is_trial === true`

### 4. Navigation Integration ✅

**AdminSidebar.tsx:**
- Added "Trial Agents" menu item to "Monitoring & Alerts" section
- Icon: TestTube (perfect for trials)
- Permission: `view.agents.enable` (same as regular agents)

**AdminViewRouter.tsx:**
- Added `'trial-agents'` to AdminView type union
- Added routing case for trial-agents view
- Integrated TrialConversionModal with state management
- Wired onConvertTrial callback to fetch trial agent and open modal
- Added onConversionSuccess callback to navigate to new agent details

**Navigation Flow:**
```
Admin Dashboard
└─ Monitoring & Alerts (sidebar section)
   ├─ Monitoring Agents (regular agents)
   ├─ Trial Agents (trial agents) ← NEW!
   ├─ Alert Configurations
   └─ Alert History
```

### 5. User Workflow ✅

**Viewing Trial Agents:**
1. Admin navigates to "Monitoring & Alerts" → "Trial Agents"
2. Dashboard shows all trial agents with status, progress, and stats
3. Search/filter to find specific trials
4. Sort by expiration date to prioritize expiring trials

**Converting Trial to Paid:**
1. Click "Convert to Paid" button on trial agent
2. Modal opens with business selection
3. Select business from dropdown
4. Choose whether to preserve trial data (default: yes)
5. Click "Convert to Paid"
6. System creates registration token automatically
7. System converts trial agent to registered agent
8. Success: redirected to new agent details page
9. Original trial marked as converted (no longer appears in active list)
